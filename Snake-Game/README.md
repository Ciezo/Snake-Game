## Getting Started

Hello! Welcome to the project, "SnakeGame", where we try to take a popular classic snake game, then, update and customize it
base on our own design using custom graphics textures. 

Moreover, this project is still an updating app where we try our best to deliver high quality content which can be enjoyed by everybody!

Let us dive right in!

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain source files and .java files 
    <br>
    <i> In this directory we also work and edit customizations, tweaks, and other code editing </i>
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

- `assets`: this directory acts as a tree to where we can fetch all     textures and custom graphic files particularly <b>.png</b> files. 
    <br>
    <i>Additionally, these artwork or graphic files are done by Cloyd Van S. Secuya who used Photoshop CC 2018 as a main tool to raster and render the images. In which took a lot of time by the way! So, he always hopes that you appreciate it whole heartedly!
    </i>  

    - `backgrounds`: this directory contains all the images to be used as a background to a panel or window
    - `dashboard`: where we store a rendered custom image of the game's dashboard which contains information about score, hearts, info level, and some navigation buttons as well. 
    <br>
    <i>Moreover, the dashboard is supposed to be positioned on the top side or north side of JFrame or JPanel 
    </i>
    
    - `fonts`: the directory where to store custom fonts as we need them when we are setting our JLabel texts with the desired typeface according to the supposed design

    - `icons`: this folder is where the <i>"buttons"</i> are stored in which it contains the Play, About, and Exit buttons all of which are to be placed on the game main home page or main menu. 
    <br>
    <i>Additionally, these acting icons are supposed to have a functionality where they change texture when a mouse hovers over these components. As such the <b>hovered icons</b> are located on the folder <b>onHover</b> which is inisde the icons dir as well. 
    <br>
    Meanwhile, this folder also contains the icons for the navigation menu found inside the dashboard which are hearts, menu, quit, restart, and settings all of which are <b>.png</b> files
    </i> 

    <br>

    - `items`: these are images to be used by the games mechanics such as the rendering and placing of apples, bombs, grass, and rocks 

    - `sample_renders`: this folder contains what we want to achieve in terms of the game's look and feel. So, feel free to explore the sample render images where we can see the home page, the gameplay look and feel, and many more
        > Additionally, this also serves as a guide on how we are supposed to place the graphic components and other positioning of elements


Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
